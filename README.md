# EventMap
**EventMap** is a website generator for showcasing real-world events/demonstrations driven by a common goal or a theme, along with a map and posted photos.

**EventMap** is based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static website generator, and the events are described in YAML-like files following a specific directory structure. **EventMap** website generation can be run and served by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

An event map consists of the main page and of campaign pages. Each campaign consists of multiple events. The main page lists all events from all campaigns.

See an example of an event map at https://vadimkantorov.github.io/eventmaptest, and of its contents at https://github.com/vadimkantorov/eventmaptest.

Below are described the file formats and the directory structure providing information about campaigns, events and the main page.

## Setting up instructions and minimal file structure of `data` directory

`data/campaigns/2022-my-campaign-name-for-url/2022-my-campaign-name-for-url.md`:
```yaml
---

logo:  main page logo, absolute https-path or file path relative to data/index/ e.g. index.jpg would refer to data/index/index.jpg 
date: # one date in YYYY-MM-DD format or array of two dates

(markdown) campaign page intro text
```

## Main page
`data/index/index.md`:
```yaml
---
title: same as for campaign pages
logo:  same as for campaign pages 
---
(markdown) same as for campaign pages
```

In general, main page file format is same as for campaign pages, but the paths are computed relative to `data/index/` instead of `data/campaigns/my-campaign-name`.

## Geocoding information
Sample of a few lines from `geocoder.json`:
```json
{
    "London": "51.5073219,-0.1276474",
    "Paris": "48.8588897,2.3200410217200766"
}
```

Crude geocoding based on city is used if an event doesn't provide custom GPS coordinates. The geocoding JSON file was originally generated by `python3 geocoder.py > geocoder.json`.
