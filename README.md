# EventMap
**EventMap** is a webpage generator for showcasing real-world events/demonstrations driven by a common goal or a theme, along with a map and posted photos.

**EventMap** is based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static website generator, and the events are described in YAML-like files following a specific directory structure. Below are described the file formats and the directory structure.

## Campaign pages
`data/campaigns/2022-my-campaign-name-for-url/2022-my-campaign-name-for-url.md`:
```yaml
---
title: campaign page header text
logo:  main page logo, absolute https-path or file path relative to data/index/ e.g. index.jpg would refer to data/index/index.jpg 
date: # one date in YYYY-MM-DD format or array of two dates
  - 2022-02-20
  - 2022-11-28

organizers: # array of following records
  - orgname: name of organizer
    orgurl: https-url of organizer announcement on the web or social media
    country: country name where an organizer is working, the same organizer may be included multiple times for different countries
    city: city name (optional)
# - orgname: ...
#   orgurl: ...
#   ...

events: # array of following records
  - city: Yerevan
    address: Freedom Square
    date: 2022-09-27
    time: "15:00"
    country: Armenia
    eventurl: https://t.me/freeyerevan/205
    orgname: Протесты в Ереване
    orgurl: https://t.me/freeyerevan
# - city: ...
#   address: ...
#   date: ...

(markdown) campaign page intro text, same as for Main page
```

## Main page
`data/index/index.md`:
```yaml
---
title: same as for campaign pages
logo:  same as for campaign pages 
---
same as for campaign pages
```

In general, main page file format is same as for campaign pages, but the paths are computed relative to `data/index/` instead of `data/campaigns/my-campaign-name`.


## Event info

## Geocoding information
`assets/geocoder.json`:
```json
{
    "London": "51.5073219,-0.1276474",
    "Paris": "48.8588897,2.3200410217200766"
}
```

Crude geocoding based on city is used if an event doesn't provide custom GPS coordinates. The geocoding JSON file was originally generated by `python3 geocoder.py > assets/geocoder.json`.

## Example directory structure
```
./assets/geocoder.json
./data/campaigns/
./data/index/index.md
./data/index/index.jpg
./data/campaigns/ABC/ABC.md
./data/campaigns/ABC/ABC.jpg
./data/campaigns/ABC/photos/EFG.jpg
```

## TODO
```
- photo crops
- link for adding custom events
```
